# Shuffler

Shuffler is a Javascript card shuffling application created for a technical assessment.

You can access Shuffler at it's Heroku domain:

https://shuffler.herokuapp.com/

## Goals

Initially I thought I would write this app with Ruby, since it is my strongest language.
However, This project was pretty open-ended, and I wanted to challenge myself,
so I took the opportunity to set these objectives:

- Create a card shuffling app in a less familiar language (Javascript rather than Ruby)
- I gave myself an entire weekend, 2.5 days, to research and implement features
- The project should be lightweight and to the point. Try not to include unnecessary folders, etc.

## Tools Used

- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- Heroku
